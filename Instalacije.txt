Frontend:

jquery
First, install jQuery using npm as follows:
npm install jquery — save
Second, go to the ./angular-cli.json file at the root of your Angular CLI project folder, and find the scripts: [] property, and include the path to jQuery as follows:
"scripts": [ "../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js" ]
Note: If you want to use bootstrap in your application, or if you already have in your project, make sure to include jQuery before including the bootstrap JavaScript file. Bootstrap’s JavaScript file requires jQuery.
"scripts": [ "../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js",
"../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js"]

bootstrap
npm install bootstrap
We have two options to import the CSS from Bootstrap that was installed from NPM:

1: Configure angular.json:

"styles": [
  "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
  "styles.scss"
]
2: Import directly in src/style.css or src/style.scss:

@import '~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
I personally prefer to import all my styles in src/style.css since it’s been declared in angular.json already.

npm install socket.io --save
